Text generating but formatting is not good 

Improved the formatting using,

Key Changes:
Using st.empty():

A placeholder (response_placeholder) is created using st.empty().
This placeholder is dynamically updated with the text chunks as they are generated.
Appending to Response Text:

Instead of writing each chunk individually, append the text to a cumulative string (response_text).
Update the placeholder with the cumulative text to ensure smooth and continuous text generation.
Markdown Formatting:

response_placeholder.markdown(response_text) is used instead of st.write(). Markdown supports more flexible formatting, including new lines and bold text.
